The following program uses primitive data type char:*/

class CharAssassination
{
  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
    char ch = 'A' ;
    System.out.println("A char: " +  ch );
  }
}

/*The variable ch is 16 bits of main memory that uses the char data type to represent characters. The a bit pattern that represents 'A' is placed in it. The program writes:

A char: A

Do the following:

    Change the 'A' into 'Z' and compile and run.
