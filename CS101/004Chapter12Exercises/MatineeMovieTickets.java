/* Description: A program that determines the price of a movie ticket 

-----
Additional Information:
. The program asks for the customer's age and for the time on a 24-hour clock (where noon is 1200 and 4:30PM is 1630). The normal adult ticket price is $8.00, however the adult matinee price is $5.00. Adults are those over 13 years. The normal children's ticket price is $4.00, however the children's matinee price is $2.00. Assume that a matinee starts at any time earlier than 5pm (1700). 

 Sales of movie tickets has been dropping! In an effort to attract more viewers, the theater has started a new policy charging $4.00 for all tickets sold after 2200 (10PM). However, no children may purchase tickets after that time. Add logic to the program of exercise 8 to implement the new policy.
